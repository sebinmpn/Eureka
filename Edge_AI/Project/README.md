### In poultry farming, rearing and management of fowls are done for two purposes-

    1.Production of the eggs.
    2.Production of meat or flesh.

#### Indian breeds - Aseel, Busra, Chittagong, Ghagus, etc.

Other than broilers and layers chicken farming models in poultry farming we fit the farming into a village low scale Hen Farm.
AI comes here to protect the chickens from wielding animals and take care of chicken like a village farmer.
